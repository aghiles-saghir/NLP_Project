5.0,Beautiful Phone Case,"This is a classy, good looking phone case. The case fits my daughter's  iPhone 6 nicely. It's a fairly firm plastic material, but it doesn't seem like it will snap into pieces or break easily. It does not interfere with any of the phone controls. My daughter has dropped her phone with this case on and her phone was completely protected.

5.0,So Much Fun!!,"I work in a Special Ed middle school class. I took this Google Cardboard into class last week and those students absolutely loved it. First of all, it was easy to put together. My husband has purchased other Cardboards and the earlier models required more work to assemble. This one was super easy and I was able to do it all by myself. I downloaded a couple of VR apps from Google Play and let the students take turns with it. My favorite moment is when one of the autistic boys had his turn. He chose the Ocean VR one. After a moment of looking through it, he started singing &quot;Part of My World&quot; from Disney's The Little Mermaid. Many of the students in my class come from low income families. And none of them had ever used one of these before, let alone seen one. They were completely enthralled with it. After allowing all of the kids to take a turn, one of the velcro pieces was starting to come up, but that's an easy fix as far as I am concerned. And other than that, it held up very well. It's definitely a high quality, cardboard.  Another fun moment was when I shared it with the other classroom aid who is almost 60. She just as excited about it as the kids were! It is pretty amazing how far technology has progressed.<br /><br />*I received this for free for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing.

4.0,Cell phone car holder,"I have a 2006 Lexus GX...  I wanted a holder for my phone that didn't use a magnet.  This holder fits that criteria. I have a Galaxy S7 and it fits nicely in the holder.  The holder itself is black.  It has a sticky, suction base.  The base has 2 adjustment spots...both are twist/screw type...  loosen, adjust and then tighten.  The top adjustment is like a ball swivel with a small amount of swivel.  The actual grabber area is interesting... you push in two tabs on opposite sides and the grippers pop open.  There is a &#34;button&#34; like knob in the center so that when you place your phone in the cradle it snaps the side pieces in place, grabbing and holding the phone.  I find that the side buttons sometimes are not very &#34;positive&#34; and you need to press them both equally at the same time or you will need to press the center button to reset and press again to get your phone positioned properly in the holding area.  There is also a loose, free moving bottom &#34;lip&#34; or &#34;edge&#34; that helps to hold the phone in place.  The circular base bottom is very, very sticky and has a reverse pressure lever.  It is VERY solid.<br />I was disappointed to see that the box I received had been opened and the item had been &#34;used.&#34;  That being said, it does work.  But I should have been sold a &#34;used&#34; product at a &#34;used price&#34; rather than the new price I paid.<br />I have included pics to help the honest buyer.  Also, my purchase is 100% independent and NOT compensated in any way. That's right - I searched this item out, on my own and bought it.

4.0,"Definitely Offers Great Phone Protection, but......","I have been wanting a real OtterBox phone case for years. I have been jealous of all my friends who have them, but I always get the cheap Android phones that never have OtterBox compatible cases. I've ordered some for my daughter who has an iPhone. Even my husband had one with a previous phone, but not me. Well, I just got a new phone (okay, a last year's model) this summer and guess what! There are OtterBox cases that are designed for it. I can't tell you how excited I was! After a few days of carefully holding my phone because it didn't have a case on it, my OtterBox arrived. I  opened the box and immediately started pulling off the plastic screen protector that was attached to the case. It was in there good and tight, but I eventually tore it away. Well, guess what? You're not supposed to remove that! I did read some other reviews and a message board and learned that some people do remove it, so I don't feel like a total loser, but still......  I ordered a screen protector separately, so it was still protected. Now back to the case. It was a little difficult to get it on the phone, but once I did, I don't think it's ever going to come off, at least until I want it to come off. It's a great looking case and I feel that it offers superb protection. There are just a few things I'm not crazy about. One,  I use a magnetic air vent phone holder for my car. The magnet slips in between the phone and the case. This case is too thick for the magnetic waves to hold it on the holder. I'm really disappointed about that. I could put a magnet on the outside of the phone case, but then the case won't look as good. Another thing that I am not fond of is that the audio output and the charging port both have covers on them. I understand the need to keep dust and such out, but it is annoying. I accidently didn't put my charging cable in all the way last night so my phone wasn't charged this morning. That cover piece had gotten in the way. Other than that, I'm happy with it. The case doesn't interfere with the volume controls. It is easy to grip. There is also an OtterBox Symmetry case available for my phone, so I may try that out to see if it takes care of my issues.",[],B00Z7SAQ5E,B07D8H81QS,AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,1531933518099,0,False,2
5.0,Easy to Find & Charges Quickly!,"My husband & I have 2 teenagers. So between the 4 of us, we have 4 Android phones, 4 tablets, & 4 laptops. We go through a lot of micro USB cables. Over the years, I have learned that not all USB cables are created equally! First of all, the plastic the covers the ends of the cables is a solid material. We have had several cables that with use, bend or break in the place where the actual cable meets. Since this is all one piece on the ends, that's not going to happen. The cable is a good length. It's long enough that if it's plugged in a lower outlet, it can still reach the end table, but it's not too long that you have a lot of excess cable getting in the way. I love that it's available in a few different colors. I selected the lime green one so it's very easy to see which cable is mine! And if anyone walks away with it, I know which child has it! At first I had this in my car with a car charger. But over the last week, I never was in my car for more than 10 minutes at a time, so I couldn't get an accurate feel for whether or not it was a fast syncing cable. This morning I brought it inside and plugged into one of our charging stations. My phone was at 50% so I was curious to learn how quickly it would charge using this cable. Within 10 minutes my phone had charged  an additional 10%. When I checked thirty minutes later, it was fully charged. I was quite pleased with that.

My last several phones have never been popular enough to have brand name cases available for them. I tried the Defender first. I really liked the case and the level of protection that it offered, but it was too thick that it didn't work with the magnetic phone holder that I use in the car. This Symmetry case does work with it. It also works with wireless charging where the Defender case did not. It's thinner and easier to put on your phone and take it off. I feel that there's adequate protection, but definitely not as tough as the Defender. The color is cute, but with the logo grooves, I'm already seeing dirt in some of the letters. A darker phone case would hide that better. The case does not interfere with the controls. The edge around the screen is raised. Overall, it's a good phone case.

3.0,"Two words: ""good"" but ""overpriced""","This is an update AFTER I have purchased the honor 8 (with a heavy discount from manufacturer)<br /><br />Everything else is as most people have observed: quality build, smooth, ample memory ...<br /><br />However, one BIG complaint I have is the dual sim - Huawei's own manual (on model FRD-L04) says it CAN be used as dual-sim (or one sim and one sd card), numerous reviews said it support dual-sim, but it doesn't from what I can tell.<br /><br />why Huawei doesn't support more LTE bands, just like they do on Mate 9??<br /><br />Another issue is with dual camera - the wide aperture is a great misnomer, wide aperture on smart phone won't give you the bokeh effect, iphone's &#34;portrait&#34; mode is much easier on usability.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I bought Honor 5x as soon as it was out on Amazon: it was a good value proposition at the time. Not so for Honor 8.<br /><br />Honor 8 - I have hands-on experience, it is a step-up from Honor 5x, but not a $200 or double-priced step up.<br />Most folks who bought the Huawei phone are not because it is really better than iPhone at half the price (though I am sure Huawei wants you to think that way). Yes, it is beautifully designed, and I like 5.2 form factor more than 5.5. The dual camera is nice - but it is not pulling ahead of either iPhone or Samsung. All in all, a good step-up from Honor 5x released in US. That comes to my second point - it is an overpriced phone.<br /><br />The same phone or other similarly configured phone (from Xiaomi, Le2 etc) will cost about $50 to $100 less, which is significant in this price range. Huawei set this price simply because they can (and a bit greedy since this is US market). No other its fellow competitors from home  have released their phones in the US, yet. There maybe some pride on Huawei's part on about its reputation and quality that they think worth the extra. This is not so in my mind: I haven't seen any phone other than iPhone that can enjoy software update for more than 3 years, and hardware can withstand it. Given my experience with Honor 5x, Huawei is no exception either.  The bottom line is, I think this is over-priced phone, a bit over 300 or even 350 would have made its name and be more competitive.",[],B01IVV7W6O,B01MXMASHF,AEIOIVFNO6QX7OYOJNPRKQEWMPGA,1473094741000,5,False,2

5.0,"Lightweight, but offers good protection with a cover; can hold several credit cards and picture ID","This is a really nice case that holds a picture ID and several credit cards and provides an easy fold cover to protect the screen with a magnet to hold it closed. It is almost like a folding wallet.  If you have this phone (Note 8), you know that the glass is curved on the edges, so it is difficult to find a screen protector that doesn't provide full coverage and doesn't go around the curved edges.  The problem with a full coverage glass protector is that just about any case that you try needs to press against the sides of the glass to hold the phone properly.  That creates a problem because the pressure of a case on the sides raises the protector off the surface of the glass.  With this case, you don't absolutely need a screen protector, as you have protection once the case is closed.  I have tried two other cases and so far I like this the best of the three.  The case is nice and thick, but soft leather, so should provide enough protection without the weight that a hard cover case would have.  I like it a lot and if this wears out, I'll buy the same case again.",[],B0751HGSMQ,B0751HGSMQ,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,1518144431693,0,False,3

It comes with a screen protector as well so the value is there. The wallet portion is just OK. I've had wallet cases that have more card slots while still being compact. I will have to take an additional wallet with me to hold all my cards. Three slots are not enough. The magnetic side is also not strong enough. Again, I've had other wallets that grip the phone when reconnected. This one feels not as strong. However, the snap closure prevents the phone from detaching in a fall which helps. So, I try not walk around  too much with it open. The case itself is thin enough to allow QI charging on the pad and in my vehicle. I can drop it in to the slot and it fits allows for fast charging. Finally, the case feels like leather.
